## Why Open-Source?

## Community

Be welcoming and open-minded - Other collaborators may not have the same
experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have
good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new collaborators
on your projects and discussions.

Assume no malice - Humans make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of
opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that
people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly
atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in
discussions, and making contributions.

Stay on topic - People use GitHub to get work done and to be more productive.
Off topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from
getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive
and productive discussions.

Be clear - Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's
hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to
use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other
person.
