## Version Control

Version control keeps a complete history of your work on a given project. It
facilitates collaboration on projects where everyone can work freely on an part
of the project without overriding othersâ€™ changes. You can move between past
versions and rollback when needed, nothing is lost. Also, you can review the
history of your project through commit messages that describe each added change
and see what exactly has changed in the contents. You can see who made the
changes and when it happened.

This is greatly beneficial whether you are working independently or within a
team.

## Intoduction to Git

## Configuring Git

The first time you use Git on a particular computer, you need to configure some things.

First, you should set your identity.
One of the most important things that version control like Git does is to keep track of who changes what.
This helps repository maintainers coordinate the efforts of all the people who contribute to the project.
Most importantly, it makes it easier to figure out who to blame when something goes wrong.
You can provide git your name and contact information with the following commands:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "<Firstname> <Lastname>"
$ git config --global user.email "<email address>"
~~~
{: .bash}

Next, you might want to change the Git text editor.
As we will see later, certain Git commands will open text files.
When this happens, Git will use your environment's default text editor, which might not be the editor you are most comfortable using.
Using configuration commands, you can tell Git to use your favorite editor.
To use Emacs as your text editor, you can do:

~~~
$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"
~~~
{: .bash}

Alternatively, to use Vim as your text editor, do:

~~~
$ git config --global core.editor "vim"
~~~
{: .bash}

A more complete list of possible editors is available [here](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html).

You can check the configuration commands that you have set using:

~~~
$ git config --list
~~~
{: .bash}

## Making Commits

Now that we have Git configured, let's try using Git do something that is actually helpful.
In this section, we are going to add the python module that we created earlier to our local Git repositories and then update GitHub to reflect this addition.

Look at your repository on GitHub.
Other than the '.gitignore' and 'LICENSE' files that were created when you first created the repository, it should be completely empty.
Our goal in this section is to upload our new module to the repository on GitHub.

First, use a terminal to cd into the top directory of the local repository.
Then, check the status of the project:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  modified:   .gitignore
  modified:   LICENSE
  modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  .DS_Store
  .codecov.yml
  .github/
  .travis.yml
  devtools/
  docs/
  myexample/
  setup.cfg
  setup.py
  versioneer.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

The part about "Changes not staged for commit" lists all of the "tracked" files that git knows are part of your repository.
We want to tell Git to store all of the changes we have made to these files in the form of a "commit".
You can prepare these for inclusion in the next commit by doing:
~~~
$ git add -u
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

  modified:   .gitignore
  modified:   LICENSE
  modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  .DS_Store
  .codecov.yml
  .github/
  .travis.yml
  devtools/
  docs/
  myexample/
  setup.cfg
  setup.py
  versioneer.py
~~~
{: .output}


The part about "untracked files" tells you that there are certain files located within your local repository that Git is not tracking (i.e., not doing version control on).

To tell Git to start tracking these files, do:

~~~
$ git add <filename>
~~~
{: .bash}

After adding all of the files that belong in the repository check the status again:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

  new file:   .DS_Store
  new file:   .codecov.yml
  new file:   .github/CONTRIBUTING.md
  new file:   .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
  modified:   .gitignore
  new file:   .travis.yml
  modified:   LICENSE
  modified:   README.md
  new file:   devtools/README.md
  new file:   devtools/conda-recipe/bld.bat
  new file:   devtools/conda-recipe/build.sh
  new file:   devtools/conda-recipe/meta.yaml
  new file:   devtools/travis-ci/before_install.sh
  new file:   docs/Makefile
  new file:   docs/README.md
  new file:   docs/_static/README.md
  new file:   docs/_templates/README.md
  new file:   docs/conf.py
  new file:   docs/index.rst
  new file:   docs/make.bat
  new file:   myexample/__init__.py
  new file:   myexample/_version.py
  new file:   myexample/data/README.md
  new file:   myexample/data/look_and_say.dat
  new file:   myexample/myexample.py
  new file:   myexample/tests/__init__.py
  new file:   myexample/tests/test_ssexample.py
  new file:   setup.cfg
  new file:   setup.py
  new file:   versioneer.py

~~~
{: .output}

Git now knows which files it's supposed to keep track of, but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet.
To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:

~~~
$ git commit -m "Adds initial module structure"
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~

 create mode 100644 versioneer.py
~~~
{: .output}

This command tells Git to save all of our changes to a new commit.

If we run `git status` now, we see that the files we added to the last commit are no longer listed.

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

~~~
{: .output}

We can see a history of all of our changes by doing `git log`:

~~~
$ git log
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$ git log
commit f67d82fc72ba33aaa34a52a649fe6e0e3b831711 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Taylor Barnes <tbarnes1@vt.edu>

    Adds initial module structure

commit 0e6266107cf8db6034d0c0cc6695851043249e5d (origin/master, origin/HEAD)
Author: taylor-a-barnes <taylor.a.barnes@gmail.com>

    Initial commit
~~~
{: .output}

`git log` lists all commits  made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's full identifier
(which starts with the same characters as
the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

Now that you have commited your module, check the GitHub repository again.
It should still only have the '.gitignore', 'LICENSE', and 'README.md' files.
This is because your local Git repository is separate from the remote GitHub repository.
To make your changes show up on GitHub, you will need to run:

~~~
$ git push
~~~
{: .bash}

This command sends all of the new commits in your local repository to the GitHub repository.
Now if you refresh the GitHub webpage you should be able to see all of the new files you added to the repository.


## Working With Multiple Repositories

One of the most potentially frustrating problems in software development is keeping track of all the different copies of the code.
For example, we might start a project on a local desktop computer, switch to working on a laptop during a conference, and then do performance optimization on a supercomputer.
In ye olden days, switching between computers was typically accomplished by copying files via a USB drive, or with ssh, or by emailing things to oneself.
After copying the files, it was very easy to make an important change on one computer, forget about it, and go back to working on the original version of the code on another computer.
Of course, when collaborating with other people these problems get dramatically worse.

Git greatly simplifies the process of having multiple copies of a code development project.
Let's see this in action by making another clone of our GitHub repository.

~~~
$ cd <location of first clone>
$ git clone git@github.com:<repository> friend
$ cd friend
~~~
{: .bash}

Make a change to the new clone.

Push the change, then Pull it to the first clone.

Create a clone of the first clone, and demonstrate that the first clone has all the same functionality as the GitHub repository.

## Ignoring Files

## Conflict Resolution

Make conflicting commits in the two different repositories.

Push one, then try to push the other.

Illustrate what kinds of commits conflict and what types don't.
