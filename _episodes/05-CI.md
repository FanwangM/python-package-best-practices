A episode covering the basics of continuous integration.

Continuous integration (CI) automatically runs builds your codes and run your
tests on a variety of different platforms. Typically this may be run when new
code is committed or before merging experimental code into the main repository.
CI useful for catching bugs before they reach your end users, and for testing
on platforms that are not available to every developer.

Most CI software and services have webhooks for integration github.

## Travis-CI and other services
    - Explain Travis and free time for OSS
    - Explain Circle and Appveyor
    - Explain other options such as Jenkins and TeamCity

## Setup of CI 
    - Describe a travis.yaml

## Describe code coverage
    - Explain why it is important
    - Explain what it is *not*
    - Explain how to enable it
