## Basic Structure
    - Module folder name
    - Basics of init

## Style Guides

Code style is important so that new developers can quickly read and understand
new code. While code style is typically quite personal, languages often have at
least a few dominant coding styles which are familiar to most programmers in
that language. Automatic formatting can enforce a particular coding style, and
are often configurable for each project.
