This episode describes how to go about starting a open-source Python
module on Github. The reasons for choosing open-source, git vs. github,
and choosing an appropriate license are discussed.

## Why GitHub for a Python Module?

1. Explain role of git, and git vs. GitHub
2. Why GitHub? Why public by default?

## Project Preliminaries
This section may be made as either presentation slides or a webpage

1. **Project/Repository Name**
  - How to pick a good name
  - Uniqueness
  - Googleableness
2. **Licenses**
  - GPL vs LGPL
  - Prefer BSD-3C, but others acceptable
  - Copyright (just mention that it depends on university and employer)
3. **Programming Language**
  - How might this influence license choice

## Creating an environment (Conda)

1. Briefly go over why environments are important
2. Set up new conda environment

## Creating a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Project name and organization**
2. **Git Ignore**
    - Pick your programming language (important later)
3. **Public vs Private**
    - Free private for academics
    - Suggest open source
4. **Initial README**

## Initial cloning

1. Perform the initial git clone
