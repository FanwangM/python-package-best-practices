## Version Control

Version control keeps a complete history of your work on a given project. It
facilitates collaboration on projects where everyone can work freely on an part
of the project without overriding othersâ€™ changes. You can move between past
versions and rollback when needed, nothing is lost. Also, you can review the
history of your project through commit messages that describe each added change
and see what exactly has changed in the contents. You can see who made the
changes and when it happened.

This is greatly beneficial whether you are working independently or within a
team.

## Intoduction to Git

## Configuring Git

The first time you use Git on a particular computer, you need to configure some things.

First, you should set your identity.
One of the most important things that version control like Git does is to keep track of who changes what.
This helps repository maintainers coordinate the efforts of all the people who contribute to the project.
Most importantly, it makes it easier to figure out who to blame when something goes wrong.
You can provide git your name and contact information with the following commands:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "<Firstname> <Lastname>"
$ git config --global user.email "<email address>"
~~~
{: .bash}

Next, you might want to change the Git text editor.
As we will see later, certain Git commands will open text files.
When this happens, Git will use your environment's default text editor, which might not be the editor you are most comfortable using.
You can configure Git to use a particular editor by issuing one of the commands in the table below:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "bbedit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| Emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| Vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |

You can check the configuration commands that you have set using:

~~~
$ git config --list
~~~
{: .bash}
