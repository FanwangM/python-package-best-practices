## Why GitHub for a Python Module?

## Creating a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Repository Name**
    - How to pick a good name
    - Uniqueness
    - Googleableness
2. **Git Ignore**
    - Pick your programming language (important later)
3. **Public vs Private**
    - Free private for academics
    - Suggest open source

GitHub's official [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).


## License Choices
    - Explain choices
    - 
3. **License Choices**


## What Makes a Good Formative Assessment

The two purposes of formative assessment are
(a) to help learners prepare for the summative assessment and
(b) to tell them and their instructor *during the lesson*
whether they're making progress (and if not, what obstacles they have hit).
If lesson episodes are 10-15 minutes long,
then formative assessments should take no more than 5 minutes.
This means that formative assessments should be:

*   multiple choice questions,
*   debugging exercises
    (in which the learner is given a few lines of code that do the wrong thing
    and asked to find and fix the bug), or
*   extensions of examples show in the lecture.

Good formative assessments do *not* require learners to write lots of code from scratch:
it takes too long,
there are usually too many possible right solutions to discuss in just a couple of minutes,
and many novices find a blank page (or screen) intimidating.
