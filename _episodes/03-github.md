## Version Control

Version control keeps a complete history of your work on a given project. It
facilitates collaboration on projects where everyone can work freely on an part
of the project without overriding othersâ€™ changes. You can move between past
versions and rollback when needed, nothing is lost. Also, you can review the
history of your project through commit messages that describe each added change
and see what exactly has changed in the contents. You can see who made the
changes and when it happened.

This is greatly beneficial whether you are working independently or within a
team.
