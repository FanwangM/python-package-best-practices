This lesson by the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute]({{ site.molssi_site }})(MolSSI)
teaches users [MolSSI's best practices](http://molssi.org/education/best-practices/)
in Python module setup. To see the full MolSSI's education mission statement, please see
[here](http://molssi.org/education/education-mission-statement/).

MolSSI best practices provides a starting point to get into software
development operations to ensure that your code is reliable and reproducible
while decreasing long-term maintenance requirements, increasing long-term
viability, and allow others to work on your code base to assist your own
efforts. Before starting into MolSSI best practice one must first think about
the user base of a given project whether this is a project only used by
yourself, within a small group, or a large community project. If your project
is small and personal you may want to consider each topic in detail before
implementing while for large community projects each topic is quite crucial.

> ## Ten Things You Need To Know
>
> 0.  Don't panic.
> 1.  Create a new lesson by using GitHub Import, *not* by forking.
> 2.  Run `bin/lesson_initialize.py` *once* in a new lesson repository to set up standard files.
> 3.  Run `make lesson-check` to check that the lesson is formatted correctly.
> 4.  Put lesson episodes in `_episodes` (or `_episodes_rmd` if you are writing in RMarkdown).
> 5.  Run `make serve` to preview the lesson website locally.
> 6.  Do *not* commit the generated HTML files in the `_site` directory.
> 7.  Style blocks and code samples by putting `{: .stylename}` on a newline *after* the block or code.
> 8.  Put solutions inside challenges using nested blockquotes.
> 9.  File issues and template fixes in the [styles repository][styles],
>     and enhancements to this documentation in this one.
